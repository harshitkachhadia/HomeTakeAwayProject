## Parts Using Bootstrap Components

The Travel Agency web app heavily utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and styling. Below is a breakdown of the parts where Bootstrap components are used:

### Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar is implemented using the `navbar` component from Bootstrap.
- Classes like `navbar-expand-lg`, `navbar-dark`, `bg-dark`, and `fixed-top` are used for styling and functionality.

### Hero Section

- The hero section uses utility classes such as `d-flex`, `align-items-center`, `justify-content-center`, and `text-center` for alignment and positioning.

### Services Section

- Cards in the Services section are styled using Bootstrap's `card` component.
- The layout is managed with the `row` and `col-md-4` grid system.

### Packages Section

- Bootstrap's `card` component is used to create uniform cards for the packages.
- The grid system (`row` and `col-md-3`) ensures responsive layouts.
- The modal functionality for the "Read More" feature is powered by Bootstrap's `modal` component.

### Contact Section

- The form in the Contact section uses Bootstrap's `form` and `form-control` classes for input styling.
- Buttons use the `btn` and `btn-custom` classes for consistent styling.

### Footer

- The footer layout utilizes Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes for spacing and alignment (`py-4`, `text-center`, etc.).

### General Styling

- Bootstrap utility classes such as `text-center`, `fw-bold`, `mt-4`, `py-5`, and `mb-4` are used throughout the project for spacing, alignment, and typography.
